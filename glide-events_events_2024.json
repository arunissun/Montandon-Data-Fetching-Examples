      "description": "Tropical cyclone Beryl has become a major hurricane forecast to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center.The hurricane headed toward the Windward Islands (Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and Martinique). On 29 June evening, Beryl was about 960 km/h east-southeast of Barbados with maximum sustained winds of near 136 km/h, moving west at around 30 km/h. Maximum sustained winds of 129 - 177 km/h or greater, rainfall accumulations of 100 to 150mm, very rough and hazardous marine conditions and storm surges are expected across St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with possible higher winds offshore. Large and destructive waves/swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. The government of St Vincent and the Grenadines has urged the population to gather emergency supplies. Shelters are to be accessible by 6 p.m. local time today. Volunteers are active in their various communities, checking the vulnerable population and assisting families preparing for the event.",

      "description": "This year, due to the escalating number of reported cases, the Secretariat of Health (SESAL) issued an epidemiological alert in February. By March, the incidence of cases had escalated to epidemic proportions.\r\nDespite extending the scope of the alert in May, the number of dengue cases and associated fatalities continued to rise. Consequently, a national emergency was declared on 31 May. According to data from the Epidemiological Alert issued by WHO on 24 May 2024, in Honduras, up to EW 19 of 2024, of the 20,563 dengue cases reported, 1,248 (6.0%) were laboratory-confirmed, and 266 (1.29%) were classified as severe dengue, as well as 27 deaths, with 11 of these fatalities directly attributed to the disease. The cases reported up to EW 19 of 2024 represent an increase of 445% compared to the same period of 2023, and 193% compared to the average of the last 5 years. In the same period, a total of 10 deaths were reported, corresponding to a case fatality rate of 0.049%.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) is providing training to local health workers, while the in-country water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) humanitarian cluster has a response plan that includes a rapid response team, capacity building, water supply and provision of non-food items (NFIs). Rapid assessment is partially hindered by ongoing conflict and access restrictions across the country. DG ECHO is assessing the situation and possible response together with humanitarian partners.",

      "description": "Dengue continues to be the arbovirus with the highest number of reported cases in the Americas region, with outbreaks occurring on a cyclical basis every 3 to 5 years. During the year 2024 between epidemiological weeks (SE, for its acronym in Spanish) 1 and 16 of 2024, a total of 6,769,140 suspected cases of dengue were reported (cumulative incidence of 717 cases per 100,000 population). This &iacute;gure represents an increase of 206% compared with the same period in 2023 and 387% compared with the average for the last 5 years (1).\r\n\r\nOn 16 February 2024, in view of the exponential increase in dengue cases observed in the &iacute;rst weeks of the year in several countries of the Region of the Americas, PAHO made an urgent appeal to Member States. The organization emphasized the need to intensify vector control measures and to maintain active surveillance, ensuring early diagnosis and timely treatment of cases (2).\r\n\r\nOn 7 March 2024, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS, for its acronym in Spanish) of Guatemala, through the Directorate of Epidemiology and Risk Management, issued an epidemiological alert for dengue (3). This alert was established to reinforce dengue control and prevention plans, based on data accumulated up to epidemiological week 7, which ended on 17 February. As of that date, a total of 6,760 cases of dengue fever had been recorded this year, of which 31 were severe cases resulting in 3 deaths. The decision to issue this alert was motivated by the beginning of the high dengue transmission season in the country. As part of this measure, speci&iacute;c epidemiological surveillance actions were reinforced, including standardized protocols for the detection, noti&iacute;cation, and registration of cases in hospitals and health areas.",

Havana, in particular, has witnessed significant incidents of severe flooding, caused by the overflowing of the Luyano River. The torrential downpours have inflicted damage across various sectors, including infrastructure, with partial and total roof collapses, disruptions to the power grid affecting over 270,000 individuals, agricultural losses, and livelihood setbacks.

This conflict has escalated and become increasingly complex, posing unprecedented challenges to the region. The situation is characterized by the presence of numerous armed actors, a large population of internally displaced persons (IDPs), and a significant number of people in need of humanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\nSince the conflict began in March 2022, approximately 1.6 million people have been displaced according to UN data. The city of Goma and surrounding areas, notably in Nyiragongo territory, have experienced multiple waves of displacement, with large numbers of people seeking refuge.\r\n",

In fact, the rise of dengue among the population led the Ministry of Health to declare a Health Emergency on 28 February in 20 regions (Supreme Decree N\u00ba004-2024-SA). As of February 24th, the number of cases reached 34,042, more than two times the number of cases in 2023 (+131.7%). The regions with the most cases are La Libertad (6,148), Piura (5,275), Ica (4,645), Ancash (3,766) and Lima (2,899). Children and adolescents infected with dengue are more than 10,000, representing 29.6% of the infected population and 13.6% of the deaths by dengue (6 out of 44).",

      "description": "On 20 January, powerful waves, driven by offshore storm surges, struck several areas in the Marshall Islands. The event originated from a powerful winter storm system in the far northern Pacific. The strong winds generated a large swell that reached Roi Namur Islet in the northern part of Kwajalein Atoll. This weather-driven wave and inundation event, distinct from a tsunami, resulted from a significant wind-generated swell breaking on the Roi-Namur shores. Reports suggest inundation in other locations, including Arno Atoll and the runway in Ailinglapalap of Marshall Islands.",

      "description": "The epidemiological curve of suspected measles cases demonstrates a rising trend since the third week of November 2023. This could be explained by increased community transmission exacerbated by the winter season and low immunization coverage. During week 15-2024, a total of 1,323 suspected cases and 4 associated deaths were reported. This represents a decrease of 13.8% in suspected cases when compared to the preceding week. The 4 deaths were reported from 3 provinces: Herat (2), Kandahar (1), and Nimroz (1); all deaths were under-five children, while 1 of them was female. Since the beginning of 2024, a total of 17,428 suspected measles cases and 87 deaths (CFR=0.5%) were reported. Among suspected measles cases, 14,022 (80.5%) were under-five children, and 7,862 (45.1%) were females. Considering the number of suspected cases since the beginning of 2024, the highest cumulative incidence of suspected measles per 10,000 population is in Balkh (13.7) followed by Samangan (13.6), Khost (10.3), and Farah (9.8) provinces.

Active measles outbreaks persist in districts such as Boulmiougou and Bogodogo in the Central region, Ouahigouya in the North region, Tougouri in the North-Central region, and Boromo and Solenzo in the Boucle du Mouhoun region. Additionally, new outbreaks have emerged in the Nongr-Masom health district in the Central region (20 cases in week 8 and 31 cases in week 9) and the Dori health district in the Sahel region (8 cases in week 8_2024 and 28 cases in week 9_2024).
